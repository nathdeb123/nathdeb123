# Hi â€” Iâ€™m nathdeb123 ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a passionate self-driven developer and learner focused on building practical security and automation tools, AI experiments, and developer utilities. I enjoy turning ideas into working prototypes using Python and full-stack web technologies, and Iâ€™m always exploring new areas in cybersecurity, automation, and machine learning.

## ðŸ“‚ How to run my projects (general)

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/nathdeb123/<repo-name>.git`
2. Create a virtual environment (for Python projects):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # on Linux/macOS
   venv\Scripts\activate   # on Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Read the repository README for repo-specific setup (API keys, model files, data, etc.)

## âœ… Suggested improvements for the GitHub profile

- Add a short bio and location to the profile to make it easier for collaborators to know who you are.
- Add a contact email or link to a personal website / LinkedIn in your profile.
- Pin 3â€“6 repositories that best showcase your skills (e.g., `Key-Sentinel-KDS`, `Network-scanner`, `Agentic-AI`).
- Add README.md files to each repo that include quick start instructions, screenshots, and usage examples.
